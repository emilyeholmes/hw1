    <p>
        Lorelai is introduced as a young single mother of a 
        teenage daughter, Rory. Lorelai has a strained relationship
         with her wealthy parents, Richard and Emily, after running
          away as a teen to raise her daughter on her own. Lorelai 
          remains estranged from her parents for many years, until 
          the events of the pilot episode, where she asks her parents
           for help with paying Rory's tuition. Her parents agree, 
           on the condition that she visits them for dinner every Friday.

        Besides an on-again, off-again relationship with Rory's father, 
        Christopher Hayden, Lorelai had a few romantic relationships 
        that included Max Medina, a teacher at Rory's school, Chilton,
         to whom she was briefly engaged; Alex Lesman, an outdoorsy 
         coffee house entrepreneur; Jason Stiles, a childhood acquaintance, 
         and Luke Danes, the owner of Luke's Diner in her adopted hometown, 
         Stars Hollow. As Lorelai frequented Luke's Diner, they grew to be 
         close friends and eventually fell in love. In the Netflix revival 
         miniseries A Year in the Life, Luke and Lorelai married.
